# AstralisLEDSign

This project is a physical and portable LED sign in the shape of the Counter-Strike : Global Offensive (CS:GO) team Astralis' logo. It is based mainly on the **FastLED** library as well as the programmable **WB2812B** LED lighting strips. Everything powered by an **Arduino Nano** and a portable powerbank.  

This readme file aims to go through the entirety of the projects' individual parts. This includes:

- How the sign is constucted
- The curcuitry and the individual components
- The code and how it connects everything together

This project is currently under development! This readme will be updated once the project is finished. Stay tuned for more
